# typefinity

A general-purpose TypeScript library with small tools and utilities that I use in my personal projects. It comes in two variants:

- [@david-04/typefinity-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@david-04/typefinity-cli)
  (for command-line applications that run in NodeJS-compatible runtime engines)
- [@david-04/typefinity-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@david-04/typefinity-web)
  (for web applications that run in the browser)
